# DumbChat
Simple Chatbot using Microsoft's DialoGPT
This is a basic chatbot project built with Python, utilizing Microsoft's pre-trained DialoGPT model for AI integration. The chatbot is designed to engage in casual conversations, leveraging the natural language processing power of the DialoGPT model. While the bot can generate human-like responses, it may sometimes produce nonsensical or random answers, as it relies on a pre-trained model with limited context understanding.

##Features:

-Conversational AI using DialoGPT.

-Responses generated based on pre-trained data.

-Built using Python for easy integration and usage.

##Limitations:

-Responses can be random or irrelevant at times due to the nature of the pre-trained model.

-The model doesn't always fully understand context, leading to occasional nonsense replies.


This project is a fun exploration of AI-powered chatbots and a simple example of how to integrate the DialoGPT model into a Python application. Itâ€™s a great starting point for anyone interested in learning more about conversational AI.
